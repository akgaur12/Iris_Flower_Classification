# Iris Flower Classification
Iris flower classification is a machine learning project that uses the Iris dataset to classify iris flowers into three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. 
The project uses the scikit-learn library to implement a classification. 
The project also includes a Jupyter notebook that walks through the steps of the project, from data loading to model training and evaluation.
